# Financial-Models
Time Series modeling/Stochastic differential equations/Black-Scholes Equation


This is a work in progress. When I have time, I will add more code on Machine learning, stochastic calculus based models, and things related to the Black-Scholes equation. I plan to make this an on going project with emphasis on C++ and Python.
